Hi there üëãüèº, glad you dropped by. 

My name is Tato. I am a software developer based in Johannesburg, South Africa. I currently work remotely for [ByteOrbit](https://byteorbit.com/) as a backend developer; mainly contributing on the Standard Bank [Shyft app](https://getshyft.co.za/).

I am a UCT alumnus with an undergraduate degree in BSc. Electrical and Computer engineering, 2018. I have spent the better part of my working career in a few startups -
building [custom LTE routers](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a9d464c297114167e1cd1f6/1550644478656-QBYP7XP16SZA98WFNM0Y/bundlebox+copy.jpg?format=2500w), cloud based network management systems and SaaS products. I am passionate about technology and all things digital.

Some things I am interested in include:

* Web development
* Software Architecture and System Design
* Cloud native and distributed systems
